# Week 2 Advanced CSS Challenge:
## Professional Portfolio
### Built a professional portfolio using HTML & CSS to showcase my skills and previous works. 

#### **Credits**
No collaborators worked on this project beyond the creator of the original content since this was just a project to refactor the existing code.

Followed tutorials present in the first module of the University of Utah's Coding Boot Camp.
